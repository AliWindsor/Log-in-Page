Firstly, I used SwiftUI over UIKit as I am more familiar with it and find it simpler to work with. This means I opted to use List over UITableView to display the data that appears after log in as SwiftUI's List contains the same basic functionalities as UITableView, just lacking a little customization.

For future work, I would like to implement a "log out" button using the environment object property.

Back button left in navigation bar in loggedin view for easy access to try out the different accounts.

Accounts are as follows (Format = Username: Password):

user: pass
helloworld: firstprogram
movielover: bestmovies

Each has a different list of items which is displayed depending on the account "logged-in".
